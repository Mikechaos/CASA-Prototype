## Purpose

This platform is a highly custom solution made for companies with complex scheduling and dispatching system handled manually.
It lets easily create jobs, with arbitrary data type (Employees, Trucks, Toolboxes, etc.) and auto-formatting into a nice 11' 17' page fitting schedule.
It gives easy to use tooling to be sure the schedule is valid (need to force the platform if want to assign an element twice on a day. Stil gives you highlighting in that case)
Schedule is tought as a collection of blocks. You can copy those blocks or dispatch them directly on multiple days, making it easy to reuse or adapt already defined jobs.


### Technology
  - Full application in Javascript and AngularJS
  - Sinatra (Ruby) for data querying
    - (Trought an abstract interface powered by sequel)


## What next?

This is an highly customizable platform. It could fit your need, needless some few adaptations? Then email me mikechaos13 at g(mail) dot c o m, we will get you up and ready in no time!
